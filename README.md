## Feature Tasks and Requirements
- The spec for lab is screen shot of Cookie Stand Admin Version 1
- pages/Index.js should…
  - Have <Head> component with page title set to Cookie Stand Admin
  - Have a header component that matches spec.
  - Have a <main> component containing <form> and a placeholder component showing JSON string of last created Cookie Stand.
  - Have a <footer> component that matches spec.
- Style app using TailwindCSS utility classes.
### Implementation Notes
- npx create-next-app –example with-tailwindcss cookie-stand-admin

- strip out unused files
  - Won’t break if they get left in, but a good practice to remove stuff you’re not using.
